	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures how efficiently an algorithm runs as input size grows. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, ensuring faster performance and better resource use.</p>
	<P> <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the input size grows. An algorithm with space complexity of O(n) uses memory proportional to the input size, ensuring efficient resource management for moderate inputs.</P>
